For a telecommunications giant, every unanswered ring spells potential disaster. It's not just a call dropping; it's a customer drifting away. Acquiring new subscribers is a costly endeavor, making customer retention far more valuable than chasing fleeting connections.

This project tackles the challenge head-on. We're building a model to predict customer churn before the dial tone fades. By delving into the intricate tapestry of customer data – their demographics, account details, and service usage – we aim to pinpoint the telltale signs of a customer on the verge of disconnecting.

The goal? Empower the company to proactively address customer needs, strengthen loyalty, and ultimately, transform those potential dropped calls into lasting connections.
